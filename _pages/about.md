I am a 2nd year PhD Candidate at Sorbone Université ([Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique (ISIR), MLIA](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/teams/mlia/?lang=en)) in an industrial collaboration with Meta ([Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/research/)) where I am working full-time in the wearable agents team. My research interests are currently focused on world mmodeling, multimodal learning and planning.

Before starting my PhD, I completed a dual degree with a Master of Engineering in Applied Mathematics from [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) and an MPhil in Electronic and Computer Engineering from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/).

I first got into machine learning through interdisciplinary projects in astrophysics at the [MSSMat Laboratory](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/soil-structures-and-materials-mechanics-laboratory-mssmat-umr-cnrs-8579).. In 2021, I moved to Hong Kong to join [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and the [Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAiRE)](https://caire.ust.hk/), where my interests shifted toward Natural Language Processing and Conversational AI, especially task-oriented dialogue systems and large language models.

During my MPhil, I worked on several projects related to healthcare and community support for the elderly in Hong Kong. These included a [Care Navigation Portal](https://portal.jcsmart.org/) for caregivers and local NGOs, the humanoid healthcare robot [Grace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2p99YPEPZk) for patients, and a virtual companion for elderly residents in retirement homes. These experiences shaped my interest in building AI systems that are practical, reliable, and genuinely useful to people.
