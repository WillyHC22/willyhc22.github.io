I am a French engineering graduate with a specific interest in machine learning and data science. I recently completed my dual degree program with a MPhil in Electronic and Computer engineering from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/), and a Master of Engineering in applied mathematics from [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/).

Before doing my second Master degree in Hong Kong, I pursued my studies in CentraleSupélec where I got my Bachelor of Engineering and got introduced to programming and machine learning through interdisciplinary academic projects in astrophysics with the [MSSMat Laboratory](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/soil-structures-and-materials-mechanics-laboratory-mssmat-umr-cnrs-8579). From 2021 onwards, I joined HKUST and the [Center for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAiRE)](https://caire.ust.hk/) where my interest shifted towards Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Conversational AI, more specifically focusing on task-oriented dialogue systems and large language models.

During my MPhil, I had the opportunity to collaborate in multiple meaningful research projects to provide assistance to healthcare and community care for the elderly in Hong Kong, such as a [Care Navigation Portal](https://portal.jcsmart.org/) for caregivers and local NGOs, a humanoid health care robot [Grace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2p99YPEPZk) for patients, and a virtual companion for elderly in retirement home.

If you are interested to collaborate, please reach out to me!
